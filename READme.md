## Perimeter Institute Computational Physics Homework Repository
Wecome to Elizabeth Bennewitz's repository for the Computational Physics taught by Erik Schnetter and Dustin Lang. Inside each of these folders are the completed homework assignments. The topic of each homework assignment is described below:
- `Homework1: ` A Julia package that computes the area and perimeter of any regular polygon
- `Homework2: ` A Julia package and script that solves differential equations, specifically the wave equation
- `Homework3: ` A python notebook that solves conservation equations using Burger's method and looks at shock capturing techniques.
- `Homework4: ` A python notebook that analyzes causality between events
